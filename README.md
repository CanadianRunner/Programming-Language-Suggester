# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### By _**Sean Keane**_

#### _This is a Quiz I created to help develop my abilities in JavaScript/jQuery.  This project represents four weeks of study at Epicodus and my attempt to navigate HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript/jQuery, and Github._

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown
* JavaScript/jQuery

## Description

_This application is my "Programming Language Suggestor."  I used HTML to craft the majority of what you're seeing informationally.  I used CSS to manipulate the text (colours, sizing, outlines, etc).  I utilized CSS Bootstrap for the buttons and creating a more asthetically pleasing website.  I used JavaScript and jQuery to develop the logic behind my quiz and make it interactive to the user.  This project while appearing simple took a considerable amount of time and energy to implement._
